# Bot or Not Backend System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the backend system of the "Bot or Not" game application. The system will manage image storage, game logic, user sessions, scoring, and administrative functions. The first version will use an in-memory database for rapid development and testing, with the ability to migrate to a persistent database system later.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Management System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to upload and manage AI-generated and real images with metadata, so that I can create challenging image pairs for players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uploads an image THEN the system SHALL store the image with metadata including filename, category, difficulty level, AI generation status, source info, and upload date
2. WHEN an administrator creates an image pair THEN the system SHALL validate that one image is AI-generated and one is real
3. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL assign a unique ID and initialize usage count to zero
4. IF an image pair is created THEN the system SHALL store the pair relationship with category, difficulty level, and creation date
5. WHEN an administrator views images THEN the system SHALL display all metadata and usage statistics

### Requirement 2: Game Session Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to track my game sessions and progress, so that my scores and streaks are properly recorded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player starts a game THEN the system SHALL create a new game session with timestamp and game mode
2. WHEN a player makes a choice THEN the system SHALL record the choice, response time, and correctness
3. WHEN a game round is completed THEN the system SHALL update the image pair success rate statistics
4. IF a player completes a daily challenge THEN the system SHALL prevent additional attempts for that day
5. WHEN a streak game ends THEN the system SHALL calculate and store the final score and streak length

### Requirement 3: Image Pair Selection Logic

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive appropriately challenging image pairs based on the game mode, so that the gameplay remains engaging and fair.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a daily challenge is requested THEN the system SHALL select 3 image pairs with balanced difficulty levels
2. WHEN a streak mode game is active THEN the system SHALL progressively increase difficulty based on current streak
3. WHEN selecting image pairs THEN the system SHALL avoid recently used pairs for the same player
4. IF no suitable pairs exist for a difficulty level THEN the system SHALL select from available pairs and log the constraint
5. WHEN an image pair is selected THEN the system SHALL increment its usage count

### Requirement 4: Scoring and Statistics System

**User Story:** As a player, I want my performance to be accurately scored and tracked, so that I can see my improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player answers correctly THEN the system SHALL calculate points based on difficulty, response time, and streak multiplier
2. WHEN a daily challenge is completed THEN the system SHALL store the total score and completion status
3. WHEN streak mode is played THEN the system SHALL track current streak, best streak, and total score
4. IF a player's performance data is requested THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive statistics
5. WHEN leaderboard data is requested THEN the system SHALL return top players sorted by relevant metrics

### Requirement 5: Administrative Interface Backend

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want backend APIs to manage the game content and monitor system performance, so that I can maintain and improve the game experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uploads an image THEN the system SHALL validate file format, size, and metadata completeness
2. WHEN image pairs are created THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and proper categorization
3. WHEN system statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive usage and performance metrics
4. IF an administrator deletes an image THEN the system SHALL handle cascading deletions for related pairs and sessions
5. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and error handling

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence and Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ability to export data from the in-memory system and migrate to a persistent database, so that data can be preserved and scaled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate JSON/SQL dumps of all tables
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL optionally load data from export files
3. WHEN migrating to persistent storage THEN the system SHALL maintain all relationships and constraints
4. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt recovery
5. WHEN backup is requested THEN the system SHALL create timestamped data snapshots

### Requirement 7: API Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure and validated API endpoints, so that the system is protected from malicious use and data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are received THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters and data types
2. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL scan for malicious content and validate file types
3. WHEN administrative operations are requested THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication
4. IF invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and status codes
5. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL temporarily block requests from the source

### Requirement 8: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance monitoring and optimization features, so that the game remains responsive under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL log response times and resource usage
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger cleanup operations
3. WHEN concurrent users increase THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 500ms
4. IF system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL report system status and key metrics
